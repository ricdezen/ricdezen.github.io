*I have been told in the past that putting famous quotes in your bio looks
pretentious, especially when you are basically, well, not famous. I consider
this to be appropriate, because I am pretentious: I pretend to be fine all
the time.*

Hello, my name is Riccardo. I am a Computer Engineering student from Italy. I
like coding, electronics, artificial intelligence, videogames, and I sometimes
forget to mention tabletop RPGs. I am keeping this small portfolio in hopes
writing down my journey through my personal projects will improve my motivation.

Considering I think I posted around 0.1% of what I coded since opening
this, I'd say it is not working.

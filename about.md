Hello, my name is Riccardo. I am a Computer Engineering student from Italy. I
like coding, electronics, artificial intelligence, videogames, and I sometimes
forget to mention tabletop RPGs. I am keeping this small portfolio in hopes it
gives me some extra motivation for when I develop small projects during my spare
time.

Hasn't really done it for me yet.

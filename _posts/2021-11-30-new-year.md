title: "New Year's Eve countdown"

The last two years have been outright terrible. Many months ago, amidst some of
the worst boredom I have ever been in, I decided to learn a bit of Javascript.
I figured a nice little project to spend an afternoon on could be a we page 
counting down for New Year's Eve, where you could play a song at a certain time,
so you could have the refrain play as the clock reached midnight.

<!-- more -->

In the end, I did it, but could not party with my friends as usual, due to Covid
restrictions. In hopes of having a shot at it this year, I am sharing it with
you [here](/projects/newyear/newyear.html), it only needs some Javascript after all.

## Interface

The interface is very simple. There are 4 divs containing the remaining time,
they are updated roughly every second. If you scroll down, you will find three
buttons. The first one allows you to load a sound file. The second one allows
you to change the background image. The third one allows you to set how many
seconds before midnight should your song start.

Most components are arranged using [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_flexbox.asp).
The only relevant part is the fixed background, an effect generally known as
[parallax](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp), which is
implemented roughly like so:

```css
.parallax {
    /* The image used */
    background-image: url("background.jpg");
  
    /* Set a specific height */
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
  
    /* Create the parallax scrolling effect */
    background-attachment: fixed;
    background-position: top;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
}
```


## Update loop

Every roughly one second, the following function is run:

```javascript
// Time before new year when song should be played, if any.
var beforeZero = 0; // From user input.

// Setting up the next year on page load.
var nextYear = new Date().getFullYear() + 1;
var newYears = new Date("1 January YEAR".replace("YEAR", nextYear.toString()));

// Remaining seconds.
var remaining = 0;

function updateTimer() {
    remaining = Math.floor((newYears - new Date()) / 1000);
    let seconds = remaining;
    let minutes = Math.floor(seconds / 60);
    let hours = Math.floor(minutes / 60);
    let days = Math.floor(hours / 24);

    // Play the song if the time has come.
    if (seconds <= beforeZero)
        spectrum.play(beforeZero - seconds);

    seconds -= minutes * 60;
    minutes -= hours * 60;
    hours -= days * 24;

    document.getElementById("days").innerHTML = days;
    document.getElementById("hours").innerHTML = hours;
    document.getElementById("minutes").innerHTML = minutes;
    document.getElementById("seconds").innerHTML = seconds;
    document.getElementById("left").innerHTML = (remaining - beforeZero) + " remaining.";

    // Avoid going to negative time when midnight passes.
    if (remaining == 0) {
        clearInterval(timer);
        fireworks.start();
    }
}
```

It just does what it looks like it does: it updates the countdown, and plays
the song when the time comes. When midnight is reached, it clears the timer that
fires it, to stop the update.

## Spectrum

You may wonder what `spectrum` is supposed to be. It is, simply put, an object
that handles playing the song, and displaying its spectrum on a canvas. To
make it I used [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a library I was somewhat familiar
with. To be properly explained, it would need its own post, but its just a
drawing loop that computes the FFT on the audio signal of the song, and uses
that information to draw lines each representing a frequency band. The code is
separate from the main script, and it's [here](/projects/newyear/spectrum.js).

Making one of these is generally a matter of minutes once you get the hang of
it.

## Fireworks

When the New Year drops, some fireworks start. Idk man I just googled "Fireworks
Javascript" and I found [this](https://fireworks.js.org/). I added this recently
actually.

Happy new year, although early, wherever you are.
